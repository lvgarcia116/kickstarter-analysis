# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to use the Kickstarter dataset to visualize campaign outcomes based on the dates they were launched and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
1. The pivot table and the line chart that was created for the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date indicates that 111 successful theatre campaigns were launched in May and June where as 37 successful theatre campaigns were launched in December. Therefore, for anyone who is pursing to launch a theatre campaign, the data indicates May or June is the best time to launch the campaign. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
2. The line chart comparing outcomes based on goals shows the percentages of campaigns that were successful, failed, and canceled by financial goal. The chart indicates that 76% of successful campaign had a goal of less than $1,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
2. One of the challenges I came across was in using the =COUNTIFS() function. The first time I ran the function (after reviewing the video under the Hint subhead) I incorrectly put in the ranges. Instead of >=10000, I only put in >1000. I did this for the rest of the ranges. I did not realize I made a mistake until I compared my line chart to what as on Bootcampspot.com. I rewatched the video til I caught my mistake.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

3. May is the best month to launch theatre campaigns as 111 successful campaigns were launched this month. In comparison, only 37 successful campaigns were launched in December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
76% of successful campaign had a goal of less than $1,000 whereas 13% of successful campaigns had a successful goal greater than $50,000.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One of the limitations is that the latest end date took place in 2017 and it is being reviewed for data trends in 2021 therefore it's possible that the financial goals and the amount that was pledged would need to increase to fund the productions. Also upon assessing the dollars amounts with failed or successful campaigns, the data analysis fails to review the correlation between backers and successful or failed campaigns.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
If you were interested in comparing percentages successful, failed, or canceled campaigns by subcategory TV in the United States, you could create a pie graph to visualize these results, a bar chart would have the similar effect.
