# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
Upon reviewing the data trends surrounding musical kickstarter campaigns, Louise should aim for less than her goal of 4,000 pounds as the average campaign goal is around 4,000 pounds. Additionally, half of the goals are less than 2,000 which is about a third for the amount raised for musical kickstart campaigns. Lastly, I recommend, upon reviewing the outcomes based on launch date, Lousise launch her kickstarter campaign in May since May is the month that launched the most successful theatre campaigns.![Lines chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86024512/122811979-1f32fb80-d29f-11eb-9edd-1707dfa84ca3.png)
